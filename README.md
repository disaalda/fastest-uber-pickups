# Assigning Fastest Uber Pick-Ups with Linear Programming

A class project to formulate a real-life problem as an optimization problem. 

I represented Uber's system of drivers and riders as 'workers' and 'jobs' in The Assignment Problem, a particular instance of Maximum Flow Minimal Cut problem. I also represented the sytem as complete bipartite graph for illustration. I included the Python notebook submitted for grading.
